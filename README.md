# pfk_tampermonkey_plugins

This repository contains several of PFK's TamperMonkey plugins.

If you want to install Tampermonkey in your Chrome browser, you can get it
from [this address](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) in the Chrome web store.

Once you have Tampermonkey installed in your browser, you can just click
the various "Install" links below to install those plugins.

## Google Calendar Tweaker

The conference room names at PFK's workplace are very long and usually don't fit
anywhere in any box they appear in in Google Calendar. This script finds those long
names and trims the redundant parts of the string out of them so they fit.

### Install : [PFK-calendar-tweaker.user.js](https://github.com/flipk/pfk_tampermonkey_plugins/raw/main/PFK-calendar-tweaker.user.js)

## Google Chat Tweaker

This tweaks Google Chat inside a GMAIL tab. NOTE the standalone
Google Chat app is not supported by this plugin, because I don't
personally use it.

* The color scheme is boring: black and white.
* Why is there sooooo gooooosh daaaarnned muuuuch whiiiiitespaaaaaace?
Scrunch up everything!!!!
* When a person has unread messages, the person's name changes to bold,
but the difference between the regular font and the bold font is so slight,
sometimes you don't notice you have unread messages!

### Install : [PFK-chat-tweaker.user.js](https://github.com/flipk/pfk_tampermonkey_plugins/raw/main/PFK-chat-tweaker.user.js)

## Google Mail Background

Stupid corp config won't let corp users put in their own custom images for
the gmail background, so I hacked one in.

### Install : [PFK-gmail-background.user.js](https://github.com/flipk/pfk_tampermonkey_plugins/raw/main/PFK-gmail-background.user.js)

## Google Mail Unread Red

When a folder has unread messages, the bold font is too similar to the regular
font to be noticable. Turn the folder name red, too.

### Install : [PFK-gmail-unread-red.user.js](https://github.com/flipk/pfk_tampermonkey_plugins/raw/main/PFK-gmail-unread-red.user.js)
