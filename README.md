# pfk_tampermonkey_plugins

This repository contains several of PFK's TamperMonkey plugins.

If you want to install Tampermonkey in your Chrome browser, you can get it
from [this address](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) in the Chrome web store.

Once you have Tampermonkey installed in your browser, you can just click
the various "Install" links below to install those plugins.

## Google Calendar Tweaker

The conference room names at PFK's workplace are very long and usually don't fit
anywhere in any box they appear in in Google Calendar. This script finds those long
names and trims the redundant parts of the string out of them so they fit.

### Install : [PFK-calendar-tweaker.user.js](https://github.com/flipk/pfk_tampermonkey_plugins/raw/master/PFK-calendar-tweaker.user.js)

## Google Chat Tweaker

The Google Chat web application is obnoxious in quite a number of ways.

* The color scheme is boring: black and white.
* The whitespace is enormous: a window 500 pixels by 500 pixels gets,
like, 12 names in it. That is just atrocious.
* When a person has unread messages, the person's name changes to bold,
but the difference between the regular font and the bold font is so slight,
sometimes you don't notice you don't have messages!
* Showing the date/time of the last interaction with a user is kind of useless.
You know what I want? How long have they been idle?
* The "more" and "less" contacts buttons take up a lot of space, and why are
there two lists of contacts? Just make one with a "more" button that expands it
when you want it.
* The "more" contacts button times out and closes itself! Why? If I want it open,
leave the gosh darned thing open!  Sorry about the language.
* Why is there sooooo gooooosh daaaarnned muuuuch whiiiiitespaaaaaace?
Scrunch up everything!!!!
* Didn't like the logo

## Google Mail Background

Stupid corp config won't let corp users put in their own custom images for
the gmail background, so I hacked one in.

### Install : [PFK-gmail-background.user.js](https://github.com/flipk/pfk_tampermonkey_plugins/raw/master/PFK-gmail-background.user.js)

## Google Mail Unread Red

When a folder has unread messages, the bold font is too similar to the regular
font to be noticable. Turn the folder name red, too.

### Install : [PFK-gmail-unread-red.user.js](https://github.com/flipk/pfk_tampermonkey_plugins/raw/master/PFK-gmail-unread-red.user.js)

## Google Hangouts Tweaker

Make color scheme of a conversation match the color scheme of the Chat Tweaker.

### Intall : [PFK-hangouts-tweaker.user.js](https://github.com/flipk/pfk_tampermonkey_plugins/raw/master/PFK-hangouts-tweaker.user.js)

## Weather.com map sidebar closer

That right hand sidebar on weather.com's radar map takes up a lot of space and is
useless. Close it.

### Install : [PFK-weathermap-sidebar-closer.user.js](https://github.com/flipk/pfk_tampermonkey_plugins/raw/master/PFK-weathermap-sidebar-closer.user.js)
